# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for Arch Linux with Hyprland, Waybar, and other tools.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, run the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Victor-Furtado/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

This will clone the repository and run the installation script.

**Note:** You may need to run `sudo sensors-detect` for Conky to work properly.

## Roadmap

- Change to eww?
- Change to fish?
- Change sudo to doas? (with a alias)
- Make a nix version
- Add features to waybar
